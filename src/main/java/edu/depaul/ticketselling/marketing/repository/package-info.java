/**
 * This package is a temporary repository package for standalone testing of marketing e-mail shipping codes.
 * 
 * I have copied the repository of backend and management, and I put b and m in front of the .java extension file to distinguish it.
 * 
 * b**.java : The repository of the backend.
 * m**.java : The repository of management.
 * 
 * When the functionality of another package is completed and linked to marketing, the repository package is disabled.
